# Viability Scoring

Every startup concept receives a viability score across multiple dimensions. Scores determine which concepts get experimented with.

```typescript
import { ViabilityScore, ViabilityDimension } from 'startups.org.ai'

const viability: ViabilityScore = {
  overall: 78,

  dimensions: {
    marketSize: {
      dimension: 'Market Size',
      score: 85,
      weight: 0.15,
      rationale: 'Healthcare CFO market is $2B+ TAM',
      signals: ['Market research reports', 'Competitor funding']
    },
    problemSeverity: {
      dimension: 'Problem Severity',
      score: 90,
      weight: 0.20,
      rationale: 'CFOs cite financial reporting as top pain point',
      signals: ['Survey data', 'Interview quotes']
    },
    solutionFit: {
      dimension: 'Solution Fit',
      score: 75,
      weight: 0.20,
      rationale: 'LLMs excel at structured financial analysis',
      signals: ['Benchmark results', 'Pilot feedback']
    },
    competition: {
      dimension: 'Competition',
      score: 60,
      weight: 0.10,
      rationale: 'Several incumbents, but none AI-native',
      signals: ['Competitor analysis', 'G2 reviews']
    },
    gtmEase: {
      dimension: 'GTM Ease',
      score: 70,
      weight: 0.15,
      rationale: 'Clear buyer persona, LinkedIn targetable',
      signals: ['Outreach response rates', 'Event attendance']
    },
    monetization: {
      dimension: 'Monetization',
      score: 80,
      weight: 0.10,
      rationale: 'High willingness to pay for financial tools',
      signals: ['Competitor pricing', 'Survey data']
    },
    defensibility: {
      dimension: 'Defensibility',
      score: 65,
      weight: 0.05,
      rationale: 'Data moat from historical financials',
      signals: ['Switching costs', 'Integration depth']
    },
    timing: {
      dimension: 'Timing',
      score: 95,
      weight: 0.05,
      rationale: 'AI adoption in finance accelerating rapidly',

  },

  tier: 'A',
  recommendation: 'test-hypothesis'
}
