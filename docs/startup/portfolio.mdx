# Portfolio

A Portfolio organizes startup concepts for tracking, comparison, and resource allocation.

```typescript
import { StartupPortfolio } from 'startups.org.ai'

const portfolio: StartupPortfolio = {
  id: 'q4-2024-experiments',
  name: 'Q4 2024 Experiments',
  description: 'Vertical AI CFO concepts for validation',

  concepts: [
    'cfo-ai-healthcare',
    'cfo-ai-legal',
    'cfo-ai-manufacturing'
  ],

  hypotheses: ['vertical-ai-cfos'],
  brandFamilies: ['headless-ly'],

  stats: {
    totalConcepts: 3,
    byStatus: {
      experimenting: 2,
      validated: 1
    },
    byTier: {
      'A': 2,
      'B': 1
    },
    avgViabilityScore: 76
  }
}
```

## Portfolio Views

**By Hypothesis** — Group concepts by their parent hypothesis

```typescript
const byHypothesis = groupBy(concepts, c => c.hypothesisId)
```

**By Brand Family** — Group concepts by brand family

```typescript
const byBrandFamily = groupBy(concepts, c => c.brandFamilyId)
```

**By Status** — Track pipeline health

```typescript
const byStatus = groupBy(concepts, c => c.status)
```

**By Tier** — Focus on winners

```typescript
const byTier = groupBy(concepts, c => c.viability.tier)
```

## Portfolio Metrics

| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `totalConcepts` | Number of concepts in portfolio |
| `byStatus` | Breakdown by lifecycle status |
| `byTier` | Breakdown by viability tier |
| `avgViabilityScore` | Average viability across concepts |

## Portfolio Strategy

- **Wide funnel** — Generate many concepts, score ruthlessly
- **Diversification** — Spread across hypotheses and industries
- **Resource allocation** — Focus experiments on highest-tier concepts
- **Kill fast** — Move invalidated concepts to killed status quickly
