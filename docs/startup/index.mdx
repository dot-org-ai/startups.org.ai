# Startup Concept

A StartupConcept is the concrete manifestation of crossing a Hypothesis with Ontology dimensions. Each concept has a unique brand, positioning, viability score, and lifecycle status.

```typescript
import { StartupConcept } from 'startups.org.ai'

const concept: StartupConcept = {
  id: 'cfo-ai-healthcare',
  slug: 'cfo-ai-healthcare',
  version: 1,

  hypothesisId: 'vertical-ai-cfos',
  ontologyTarget: {
    occupationId: 'ChiefFinancialOfficer',
    industryId: 'Healthcare'
  },

  name: {
    name: 'MedFinance AI',
    tagline: 'Your AI CFO for Healthcare',
    domain: 'medfinance.ai',
    naming: {
      pattern: 'compound',
      memorability: 'high',
      spellability: 'easy'
    }
  },

  oneLiner: 'AI-powered financial management for healthcare organizations',
  problem: {
    external: 'Healthcare CFOs spend 60% of time on manual reporting',
    internal: 'Constant anxiety about compliance and cash flow',
    philosophical: 'Healthcare should focus on patients, not paperwork'
  },

  viability: {
    overall: 78,
    tier: 'A',
    recommendation: 'test-hypothesis'
  },

  status: 'scored'
}
```

## Concept Lifecycle

```
generated → scored → selected → experimenting → validated/invalidated → building → launched
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `generated` | Just created, not yet reviewed |
| `scored` | Viability score assigned |
| `selected` | Chosen for experimentation |
| `experimenting` | Active experiments running |
| `validated` | Hypothesis confirmed |
| `invalidated` | Hypothesis disproven |
| `building` | Product under construction |
| `launched` | Live in market |
| `paused` | Temporarily on hold |
| `killed` | Abandoned |
