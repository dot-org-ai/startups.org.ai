# Funnel Tracking

Funnels track how prospects move through stages toward conversion.

```typescript
import { Funnel, FunnelStage } from 'startups.org.ai'

const funnel: Funnel = {
  id: 'healthcare-cfo-funnel',
  name: 'Healthcare CFO Acquisition Funnel',
  stages: [
    {
      id: 'awareness',
      name: 'Awareness',
      order: 1,
      description: 'Prospect sees content or ad',
      entryMetric: 'impressions',
      exitMetric: 'clicks'
    },
    {
      id: 'interest',
      name: 'Interest',
      order: 2,
      description: 'Prospect visits landing page',
      entryMetric: 'visits',
      exitMetric: 'time-on-site'
    },
    {
      id: 'consideration',
      name: 'Consideration',
      order: 3,
      description: 'Prospect joins waitlist',
      entryMetric: 'waitlist-signups',
      exitMetric: 'email-opens'
    },
    {
      id: 'intent',
      name: 'Intent',
      order: 4,
      description: 'Prospect requests demo',
      entryMetric: 'demo-requests',
      exitMetric: 'meetings-booked'
    },
    {
      id: 'conversion',
      name: 'Conversion',
      order: 5,
      description: 'Prospect becomes customer',
      entryMetric: 'trial-starts',
      exitMetric: 'conversions'
    }
  ],
  metrics: {
    topOfFunnel: 10000,
    bottomOfFunnel: 50,
    overallConversion: 0.5,
    stageConversions: {
      'awareness-to-interest': 5.0,
      'interest-to-consideration': 20.0,
      'consideration-to-intent': 10.0,
      'intent-to-conversion': 50.0
    }
  }
}
```

## Standard Funnel Stages

| Stage | Description | Key Metric |
|-------|-------------|------------|
| Awareness | First exposure | Impressions |
| Interest | Active engagement | Visits |
| Consideration | Evaluating | Signups |
| Intent | Ready to buy | Demo requests |
| Conversion | Became customer | Customers |

## Funnel Metrics

**Top of Funnel (TOFU)** — Entries at first stage

**Bottom of Funnel (BOFU)** — Conversions at final stage

**Overall Conversion** — BOFU / TOFU

**Stage Conversion** — Exits / Entries for each stage

## Identifying Bottlenecks

```typescript
const findBottleneck = (funnel: Funnel) => {
  const conversions = Object.entries(funnel.metrics.stageConversions)
  return conversions.reduce((min, [stage, rate]) =>
    rate < min.rate ? { stage, rate } : min,
    { stage: '', rate: 100 }
  )
}

// Find where you're losing the most people
const bottleneck = findBottleneck(funnel)
// → { stage: 'interest-to-consideration', rate: 20.0 }
```

## Funnel Optimization

1. **Identify bottleneck** — Which stage has lowest conversion?
2. **Diagnose cause** — Why are people dropping off?
3. **Hypothesis** — What change might improve it?
4. **Experiment** — Run funnel-optimization experiment
5. **Measure** — Did stage conversion improve?
