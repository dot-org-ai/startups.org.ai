# Experiment Types

Different experiment types serve different purposes in the startup journey.

```typescript
import { ExperimentType } from 'startups.org.ai'

type Type =
  // Validation
  | 'demand-validation'       // Is there demand?
  | 'message-testing'         // Which message resonates?
  | 'channel-testing'         // Which channel works?
  | 'price-testing'           // What price point works?
  | 'audience-testing'        // Which audience converts?

  // Growth
  | 'acquisition'             // Can we acquire users?
  | 'activation'              // Can we activate users?
  | 'retention'               // Can we retain users?
  | 'referral'                // Can we get referrals?
  | 'revenue'                 // Can we monetize?

  // Optimization
  | 'conversion-optimization' // Improve conversion rates
  | 'content-optimization'    // Improve content performance
  | 'funnel-optimization'     // Improve funnel metrics
```

## Validation Experiments

Run these before building to confirm demand.

| Type | Question | Success Signal |
|------|----------|----------------|
| `demand-validation` | Is there demand? | Waitlist signups, demo requests |
| `message-testing` | Which message works? | Higher engagement/conversion |
| `channel-testing` | Which channel works? | Lower CAC, higher volume |
| `price-testing` | What price works? | Conversion at target price |
| `audience-testing` | Who is the buyer? | Segment with best metrics |

## Growth Experiments

Run these after product-market fit to scale.

| Type | Question | Success Signal |
|------|----------|----------------|
| `acquisition` | Can we get users? | CAC, volume, quality |
| `activation` | Will they use it? | Activation rate, time-to-value |
| `retention` | Will they stay? | Retention cohorts, churn |
| `referral` | Will they share? | Viral coefficient, NPS |
| `revenue` | Will they pay? | Conversion rate, ARPU |

## Optimization Experiments

Run these to improve existing performance.

| Type | Question | Success Signal |
|------|----------|----------------|
| `conversion-optimization` | Can we convert more? | Higher conversion rate |
| `content-optimization` | Can content perform better? | Rankings, engagement |
| `funnel-optimization` | Can we reduce drop-off? | Stage conversion rates |

## Experiment Sequence

```
1. demand-validation    → Is this worth building?
2. message-testing      → How do we position it?
3. channel-testing      → Where do we find customers?
4. price-testing        → What should we charge?
5. audience-testing     → Who exactly is the buyer?
```
