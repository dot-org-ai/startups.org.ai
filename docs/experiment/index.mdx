# Experiment

Experiments validate startup concepts before investing in building. Test demand, messaging, channels, and pricing through structured experiments.

```typescript
import { Experiment, ExperimentType, ExperimentChannel } from 'startups.org.ai'

const experiment: Experiment = {
  id: 'cfo-ai-healthcare-landing-page',
  name: 'Healthcare CFO Landing Page Test',
  description: 'Validate demand with targeted landing page',

  startupConceptId: 'cfo-ai-healthcare',

  type: 'demand-validation',
  channel: 'landing-page',
  channelCategory: 'direct',

  hypothesis: {
    statement: 'If we create a landing page targeting healthcare CFOs, then we will get 2%+ conversion to waitlist because they actively seek AI solutions for financial reporting.',
    assumption: 'Healthcare CFOs are searching for AI financial tools',
    successCriteria: [
      { metric: 'conversion-rate', operator: '>=', target: 2, description: '2%+ waitlist conversion' }
    ]
  },

  design: {
    type: 'ab-test',
    variants: [
      { id: 'control', name: 'Professional', allocation: 50 },
      { id: 'variant-a', name: 'Technical', allocation: 50 }
    ],
    duration: '2 weeks'
  },

  status: 'running'
}

## Experiment Lifecycle

```
planned → setup → running → paused → completed → analyzing → concluded
```

| Status | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `planned` | Designed but not started |
| `setup` | Being configured |
| `running` | Currently active |
| `paused` | Temporarily stopped |
| `completed` | Finished running |
| `analyzing` | Reviewing results |
| `concluded` | Analysis complete |

## Results

| Result | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `winner` | Clear winner identified |
| `loser` | Failed to meet criteria |
| `inconclusive` | Not enough data |
| `learning` | Generated insights but no clear winner |
