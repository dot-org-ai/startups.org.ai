# Generate, Validate, and Scale Startup Concepts

Startups.org.ai provides the schemas and abstractions for generating millions of startup concepts by crossing hypotheses with ontology dimensions, then validating them through systematic experimentation.

## The Startup Factory

Traditional startup creation is artisanal—one idea, one team, one bet. Startups.org.ai industrializes the process:

- **Hypothesis-Driven** — Define meta-strategies like "Headless SaaS for Agents" or "Vertical AI by Occupation" that generate thousands of concrete concepts.
- **Ontology-Powered** — Cross-product hypotheses with occupations, industries, processes, and tasks from O*NET, NAICS, and APQC taxonomies.
- **Experiment Everything** — Validate demand through SEO, social, outbound, and paid channels before building.
- **Score and Rank** — AI-powered viability scoring across market size, problem severity, solution fit, and more.

## Get Started

```typescript
import { Hypothesis, StartupConcept, Experiment } from 'startups.org.ai'

// Define a hypothesis
const hypothesis: Hypothesis = {
  id: 'vertical-ai-cfo',
  name: 'Vertical AI CFOs',
  thesis: 'Every occupation needs an AI copilot for financial decisions',
  // ...
}

// Generate concepts
const concepts: StartupConcept[] = generateFromHypothesis(hypothesis, ontology)

// Run experiments
const experiment: Experiment = {
  type: 'demand-validation',
  channel: 'landing-page',
  // ...
}
```

Start with [Hypothesis](/hypothesis)—the foundation of the startup factory.
