# Scoring Phase

The scoring phase evaluates each concept's viability across multiple dimensions to identify winners.

```typescript
import { scoreConcept, rankConcepts } from 'startups.org.ai'

// Score individual concept
const { score, topStrengths, topWeaknesses, recommendation } = await scoreConcept({
  concept,
  enrichedIndustry,
  enrichedOccupation
})

// Rank multiple concepts
const { ranked, tiers } = await rankConcepts({
  concepts,
  weights: {
    marketSize: 0.15,
    problemSeverity: 0.20,
    solutionFit: 0.20,
    // ...
  },
  topN: 10
})
```

## Scoring Dimensions

| Dimension | Weight | Evaluates |
|-----------|--------|-----------|
| `marketSize` | 15% | TAM/SAM potential |
| `problemSeverity` | 20% | How painful is the problem? |
| `solutionFit` | 20% | How well does AI solve it? |
| `competition` | 10% | Competitive landscape |
| `gtmEase` | 15% | Ease of reaching customers |
| `monetization` | 10% | Ability to monetize |
| `defensibility` | 5% | Moat potential |
| `timing` | 5% | Market timing |

## Score Output

```typescript
const score: ViabilityScore = {
  overall: 78,
  dimensions: {
    marketSize: {
      dimension: 'Market Size',
      score: 85,
      weight: 0.15,
      rationale: 'Healthcare CFO market is $2B+ TAM',
      signals: ['Market research', 'Competitor funding']
    },
    problemSeverity: { ... },
    solutionFit: { ... },
    // ...
  },
  tier: 'A',
  recommendation: 'test-hypothesis'
}

const analysis = {
  topStrengths: [
    'Large addressable market',
    'Severe pain point',
    'AI-native solution possible'
  ],
  topWeaknesses: [
    'Crowded competitive space',
    'Long enterprise sales cycles'
  ],
  recommendation: 'Strong opportunity. Run demand validation experiment.'
}
```

## Ranking Concepts

```typescript
const { ranked, tiers } = await rankConcepts({
  concepts,
  topN: 20  // Return top 20
})

// ranked: sorted by score
// tiers: { 'S': ['id1'], 'A': ['id2', 'id3'], ... }
```

## Custom Weights

Adjust dimension weights for your strategy:

```typescript
const weights = {
  // Prioritize problem severity
  problemSeverity: 0.30,  // Up from 0.20
  solutionFit: 0.25,      // Up from 0.20
  marketSize: 0.10,       // Down from 0.15
  // ...
}

const { ranked } = await rankConcepts({ concepts, weights })
```

## Tier Classification

| Tier | Score | Recommendation |
|------|-------|----------------|
| S | 90-100 | Pursue aggressively |
| A | 80-89 | Test hypothesis |
| B | 70-79 | Explore further |
| C | 60-69 | Deprioritize |
| D | <60 | Skip |
