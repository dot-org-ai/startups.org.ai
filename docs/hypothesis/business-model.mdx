# Business Model

The business model defines how startups from this hypothesis create and capture value.

```typescript
import { BusinessModel, BusinessModelType } from 'startups.org.ai'

const model: BusinessModel = {
  type: 'api',
  targetCustomer: 'agent',
  segments: ['startup', 'mid-market', 'enterprise'],
  delivery: 'api',
  pricing: {
    model: 'usage',
    freeTier: true,
    startingPrice: 29,
    enterpriseCustom: true
  },
  valueProps: [
    { primary: 'automation', statement: '10x faster than manual processes' }
  ],
  moat: 'Proprietary training data from serving millions of API calls'
}
```

## Business Model Types

| Type | Description | Best For |
|------|-------------|----------|
| `saas` | Software-as-a-Service with UI | Human users, recurring revenue |
| `api` | API-as-a-Service | AI agents, developers |
| `paas` | Platform-as-a-Service | Builders, developers |
| `marketplace` | Two-sided marketplace | Matching supply and demand |
| `productized` | Productized service | Fixed-scope deliverables |
| `agency` | Service delivery agency | Custom work at scale |
| `data` | Data-as-a-Service | Insights and intelligence |
| `infrastructure` | Infrastructure provider | Foundation layers |

## Target Customer

```typescript
type TargetCustomerType = 'agent' | 'human' | 'hybrid'
```

- **agent** — AI agents consume the service via API. No UI needed.
- **human** — Traditional human users with full UI/UX.
- **hybrid** — Both agents and humans. API + UI.
