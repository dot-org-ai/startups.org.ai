# Value Propositions

Value propositions define how your startup differentiates from alternatives. Each hypothesis should have 1-3 clear value prop angles.

```typescript
import { ValueProposition, ValuePropAngle } from 'startups.org.ai'

const valueProp: ValueProposition = {
  primary: 'speed',
  secondary: 'cost',
  statement: 'Get financial reports in minutes, not weeks',
  quantified: '100x faster than manual processes'
}
```

## Value Prop Angles

| Angle | Description | Example Statement |
|-------|-------------|-------------------|
| `speed` | Faster than alternatives | "10x faster than manual" |
| `cost` | Cheaper than alternatives | "90% cost reduction" |
| `quality` | Better output quality | "Enterprise-grade accuracy" |
| `ease` | Easier to use | "No training required" |
| `compliance` | Meets regulations | "SOC 2 and HIPAA ready" |
| `integration` | Works with existing tools | "Connects to your stack" |
| `automation` | Reduces manual work | "Set it and forget it" |
| `intelligence` | Provides insights | "AI-powered recommendations" |
| `scale` | Handles more volume | "From 10 to 10,000 transactions" |
| `reliability` | More dependable | "99.99% uptime guaranteed" |

## Crafting Value Props

**Primary angle** — The main differentiator. What makes you 10x better?

**Secondary angle** — Supporting differentiator. Reinforces the primary.

**Statement** — One sentence that captures the value. Use customer language.

**Quantified** — Put a number on it. "10x", "90%", "in minutes".

```typescript
const valueProps: ValueProposition[] = [
  {
    primary: 'automation',
    statement: 'Your AI CFO that never sleeps',
    quantified: 'Saves 20 hours per week'
  },
  {
    primary: 'intelligence',
    secondary: 'speed',
    statement: 'Real-time financial insights, not monthly reports'
  }
]
```
