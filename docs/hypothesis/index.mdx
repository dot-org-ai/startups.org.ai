# Hypothesis

A Hypothesis is a meta-strategy that defines a class of startups. Rather than betting on a single idea, you define a pattern that generates thousands of concrete concepts when crossed with ontology dimensions.

```typescript
import { Hypothesis } from 'startups.org.ai'

const hypothesis: Hypothesis = {
  id: 'headless-saas',
  name: 'Headless SaaS for Agents NOT Humans',
  thesis: 'AI agents need APIs, not UIs. Build SaaS that agents consume directly.',
  businessModel: {
    type: 'api',
    targetCustomer: 'agent',
    segments: ['startup', 'enterprise'],
    // ...
  },
  dimensions: {
    occupations: { enabled: true, priority: 8 },
    industries: { enabled: true, priority: 6 },
    processes: { enabled: true, priority: 9 },
    // ...
  }
}
```

## Examples

| Hypothesis | Thesis | Target |
|------------|--------|--------|
| Headless SaaS | APIs for agents, not UIs for humans | AI Agents |
| Vertical AI Agents | Every occupation needs an AI copilot | Knowledge Workers |
| On-Demand Services | Human-quality work delivered by AI | SMBs |
| Industry Workflows | Automate industry-specific processes | Enterprises |

## How It Works

1. **Define the thesis** — What fundamental belief does this hypothesis test?
2. **Configure dimensions** — Which ontology dimensions matter most?
3. **Set constraints** — Minimum viability scores, max concepts, required dimensions
4. **Generate concepts** — Cross-product produces thousands of startup ideas
5. **Score and rank** — AI evaluates market size, problem severity, solution fit

See [Business Model](/hypothesis/business-model) to configure your hypothesis.
