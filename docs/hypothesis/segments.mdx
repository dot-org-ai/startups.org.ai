# Customer Segments

Define which customer segments your hypothesis targets. Segment selection affects everything from pricing to go-to-market strategy.

```typescript
import { CustomerSegment } from 'startups.org.ai'

const segments: CustomerSegment[] = [
  'enterprise',    // 1000+ employees
  'mid-market',    // 100-1000 employees
  'smb',           // 10-100 employees
  'startup',       // Early-stage companies
  'solopreneur',   // Individual entrepreneurs
  'agency',        // Marketing, design, dev agencies
  'consumer'       // Individual consumers (B2C)
]
```

## Segment Characteristics

| Segment | Size | Sales Cycle | ACV | Decision Maker |
|---------|------|-------------|-----|----------------|
| Enterprise | 1000+ | 6-18 months | $50K-$1M+ | Committee |
| Mid-Market | 100-1000 | 2-6 months | $10K-$50K | VP/Director |
| SMB | 10-100 | 1-4 weeks | $1K-$10K | Owner/Manager |
| Startup | <50 | Days-weeks | $500-$5K | Founder |
| Solopreneur | 1 | Instant | $10-$500/mo | Self |
| Agency | Varies | 1-4 weeks | $2K-$20K | Principal |
| Consumer | 1 | Instant | $0-$50/mo | Self |

## Segment Selection

Choose segments based on your hypothesis:

```typescript
const hypothesis: Hypothesis = {
  id: 'vertical-ai-cfos',
  businessModel: {
    segments: ['mid-market', 'smb'],  // Priority order matters
    // Mid-market is primary target, SMB is secondary
  }
}
```
