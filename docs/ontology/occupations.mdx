```typescript
import { Occupation, OccupationSegment, OccupationCategory } from 'startups.org.ai'

const occupation: Occupation = {
  ns: 'jobs.org.ai',
  type: 'Job',
  id: 'ChiefFinancialOfficer',
  name: 'Chief Financial Officer',
  description: 'Plan, direct, or coordinate accounting, investing, banking, insurance, securities, and other financial activities of a branch, office, or department of an establishment.',
  code: '11-3031.00',
  shortName: 'CFO',
  sourceType: 'ONETOccupation',
