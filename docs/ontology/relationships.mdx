# Relationships

Relationships connect ontology entities, enabling richer startup concept generation.

```typescript
import { OntologyRelationship, RelationshipType } from 'startups.org.ai'

const relationship: OntologyRelationship = {
  fromType: 'Occupation',
  fromId: 'ChiefFinancialOfficer',
  toType: 'Task',
  toId: 'PrepareFinancialReports',
  relationshipType: 'has-task',
  weight: 0.95  // How central this task is to the occupation
}
```

## Relationship Types

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| `has-task` | Occupation performs task | CFO → Prepare Reports |
| `uses-tool` | Occupation uses technology | Accountant → Excel |
| `in-industry` | Occupation common in industry | CFO → Healthcare |
| `requires-skill` | Task requires skill | Financial Analysis → Excel |
| `part-of` | Hierarchy relationship | Hospitals → Healthcare |
| `related-to` | General association | CFO → Controller |
| `alternative-to` | Similar/competing | QuickBooks → Xero |
| `depends-on` | Prerequisite | Reporting → Data Entry |

## Relationship Weights

Weights (0-1) indicate relationship strength:

| Weight | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| 0.9-1.0 | Core/essential relationship |
| 0.7-0.9 | Strong relationship |
| 0.5-0.7 | Moderate relationship |
| 0.3-0.5 | Weak relationship |
| 0.0-0.3 | Peripheral relationship |

## Querying Relationships

```typescript
// Find all tasks for an occupation
const cfoTasks = relationships
  .filter(r =>
    r.fromType === 'Occupation' &&
    r.fromId === 'ChiefFinancialOfficer' &&
    r.relationshipType === 'has-task'
  )
  .sort((a, b) => b.weight - a.weight)

// Find occupations that use a technology
const excelUsers = relationships
  .filter(r =>
    r.toType === 'Technology' &&
    r.toId === 'MicrosoftExcel' &&
    r.relationshipType === 'uses-tool'
  )
```

## Relationship-Based Generation

Use relationships to generate more targeted concepts:

```typescript
const generateFromRelationships = (occupationId: string) => {
  // Find high-weight tasks
  const coreTasks = getTasksForOccupation(occupationId)
    .filter(r => r.weight > 0.8)

  // Find tools they use
  const tools = getToolsForOccupation(occupationId)

  // Find industries they work in
  const industries = getIndustriesForOccupation(occupationId)

  // Generate concepts that automate core tasks
  // in target industries, integrating with existing tools
}
```
