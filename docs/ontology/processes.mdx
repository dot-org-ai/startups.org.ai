```typescript
import { Process, ProcessCategory } from 'startups.org.ai'

const process: Process = {
  ns: 'process.org.ai',
  type: 'Process',
  id: 'ManageAccountsReceivable',
  name: 'Manage Accounts Receivable',
  description: 'Process customer credit, invoice customers, process AR, manage and process collections, manage and process adjustments and deductions.',
  code: '8.2',
